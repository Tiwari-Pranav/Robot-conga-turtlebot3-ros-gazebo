== üîé Overview

The *Robot-Conga* project demonstrates coordinated leader‚Äìfollower locomotion in a multi-agent system.  
It leverages *ROS* and *Gazebo* for real-time robotics simulation and can be adapted for quadrupeds or wheeled robots.  

This project can be extended for:
- Swarm robotics research
- Reinforcement learning
- Path-following experiments
- Multi-agent system coordination

---

== üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- *Python* ‚Äì Primary programming language
- *ROS (Robot Operating System)* ‚Äì Middleware for robot control
- *Gazebo* ‚Äì Physics-based robotics simulator
- *PyBullet* ‚Äì Alternative physics engine (legacy implementation)
- *NumPy / Matplotlib* ‚Äì Numerical computation and visualization

== üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

. Clone the repository
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/Tiwari-Pranav/Robot-conga-turtlebot3-ros-gazebo/
cd Robot-conga-turtlebot3-ros-gazebo
----

. Install dependencies  
Make sure you have **ROS Humble** (or compatible version) and **Gazebo** installed.  
If using `rosdep`:
+
[source,bash]
----
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
----

. Build the workspace
+
[source,bash]
----
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
----

. Launch a simulation
+
[source,bash]
----
roslaunch robot_conga leader_follower.launch
----
